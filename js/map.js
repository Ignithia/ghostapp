The complex and fragmentary group of frescoes decorating the walls of the nave of San Domenico – more than 50 subjects in addition to some fragments not easy to interpret – constitutes one of the most relevant painting testimonies of the central Italy of 14th and 15 centuries.",

After the building of the new boundaries at the end of 13th century, the building was between the two city walls and took the name of “Infra portas”. The walls of this church contain a real art gallery of the best artists from Foligno: just to name a few, Niccolò di Liberatore called l'Alunno, Pierantonio Mezzastris, Giovanni di Corraduccio, Ugolino di Gisberto, Lattanzio di Niccolò, Cristoforo di Jacopo, pupil of Bartolomeo di Tommaso worked there. Externally, to the right of the porch, there is an aedicula dating back to 1480 with a sinopia of the fresco of Sant'Anna crowned by angels, attributable to Mezzastris; at the end of the right side there is the Romanesque bell tower.",

Piermarini was the architect who designed La Scala in Milan, and his works were also commissioned by the Habsburgs. The city of Foligno, a few years after his death, dedicated to him the theatre of the same name that stood on this spot, but after many performances, on 16 May 1944, it was destroyed by a bombing, and today we can admire its façade and foyer. In the square, a spectacular work by Ivan Theimer is on display, the Hercules, dedicated precisely to Giuseppe Piermarini. Are you familiar with the myth of Hercules? It is about the Greek hero famous for his superhuman strength. Instead of being depicted holding up the legendary columns, the image of the ultimate boundary of the known world and thus of human wisdom, in this case Hercules holds up an Egyptian obelisk. With this work, Theimer wished to represent how the West has overstepped the boundary of considering itself the true cradle of knowledge, whereas knowledge is a broader concept, resulting from the union of several cultures.",

The artwork (whose official name is “Ricordo del dolore umano”, that is “Remembrance of human pain”), represents an hourglass with turtles, symbol of eternity of time and a bronze frieze that remembers some moments of the history of the city: the sacrifice of Colomba Antonietti, the partisan Franco Ciri murdered by fascists, the Tucci family murdered in Sant'Anna di Stazzema by Nazi, the aerial bombardment of 22 November 1943 and the earthquake of 1997. The three turtles are the symbol of eternity of time and, together with the bronze putti, they frequently recur in the sculptor’s works. The chosen materials are used to represent the passing of time as well: both bronze and stone tend to change color over the years. Try to put your hand inside the mouth of the biggest turtle!
